<h3>Simple Linear Regression Project</h3>
<br>
This project is based on a simple linear regression model using the placement.csv dataset.
The dataset has around 200 records and contains no missing values.
<br>
The goal of this project is to predict a continuous target value using one independent variable.
The model works, but the predictions are not very accurate — for example, when the actual value is 4.3, the predicted value is around 3.89.
<br>
This shows that the model can be improved with more data or better features, but it still gives a basic understanding of how linear regression works.
